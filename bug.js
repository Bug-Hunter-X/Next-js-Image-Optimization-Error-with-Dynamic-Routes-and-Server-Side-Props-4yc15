In Next.js, an uncommon error can occur when using server-side props (getStaticProps or getServerSideProps) with dynamic routes and image optimization. The issue arises when the image path is incorrectly constructed, leading to a 404 error or an unexpected image display. This often happens when the image path is relative to the page component, rather than the public directory or an asset path correctly handled by Next.js's image optimization features.

For example, if you have an image located at `public/images/my-image.jpg` and you try to access it using a relative path like `/images/my-image.jpg` within your `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function, Next.js might not find it. This is because the server-side functions operate within a different context compared to the client-side rendering.
